For this Project I designed a web app using javascript that determines if you have the coronavirus based off of the questions provided.  There are 4 total questions, each one asking if you have a certain symptom related to the coronavirus.  If the users answers are all 'yes' for the 4 questions, then the app returns the result that the user has the virus.  If the user answers 'yes' to 3 out of the 4 questions, then the app returns the result that the user 'most likely' has the virus.  That pattern continues for the other 3 possible outcomes.  The amount of times the user answers 'yes' for a question, increments +2 to a variable that effects which result gets displayed in the end.  The function calcResults() sums up the total for the results once all the questions are answered.  I used a template for the design on codepen but restyled the page by changing the background color to a background image and adding a navbar that can return the user back to the portfolio page.  I also added photos with each result so that there is a better presentation to the results.
